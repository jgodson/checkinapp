# checkinapp
This app allows users to check in at their current location based on the location their browser determines (this will use GPS on capable devices). Additionally, there is an administrator area that allows you to see user check ins and manage various settings to alert if check ins are late.

If you would like to give it a test, use the following credentials:<br />

Admin Portal:<br />
username: demoaccount<br />
password: demoaccount<br />

User Check Ins:<br />
username: user1 (or) user2 (or) user3<br />
password: demoaccount<br />
